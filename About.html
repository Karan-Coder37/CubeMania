        <hr size=4 color=red>
    <p>Hi! I am Karan Vohra, a student studying in the 8th grade in Mind Tree School, Ambala.<br>
    Coding is a side hobby/ interest of mine. As you can see, I love cubing. I have been cubing for two years at this point in 2022. My main events are 3x3, 4x4 and Square-1. For 3x3, I am currently struggling to break that sub-10 barrier. Hopefully, I get there soon.
<br>
CubeMania is my very first website. So there might be some glaring oversights. Still at this moment, I am very proud of this website, of the fact that I have been able to create one with such limited knowledge. I will keep on updating this website since it is very near and dear to my heart.
    </p>
